I have implemented api in such way the user can post the rating for best picture category for now.
and will get the top 10 record as per rating for best picture category only.

We can do that for whole categories but needed a script changes which will copy the all category data in movie table.
so user can post rating to other categories as well and user can see top rated movie list.
